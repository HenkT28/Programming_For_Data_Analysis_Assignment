# Programming_For_Data_Analysis_Assignment repository

This repository contains all my work for Programming for Data Analysis Assignment 2019. To access the repository, please go through below instructions.

1; Go to Github web site - User Account: HenkT28

<https://github.com/HenkT28>

2; Then go to Repositories, and select Programming_For_Data_Analysis_Assignment. Alternatively go to "Clone or download" drop down menu and copy below url:

<https://github.com/HenkT28/Programming_For_Data_Analysis_Assignment.git>

Then open up cmder (see futher below for download instructions) and run below command to clone the repository locally on your machine:

* git clone <https://github.com/HenkT28/Programming_For_Data_Analysis_Assignment.git>

## Problem statement

This readme contains background info, instructions, and research concerning the numpy.random package in Python [2].
I was required to create a Jupyter [5] notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.

2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.

3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.

4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

### Prerequisites - how to run the code

1; I'll be using Cmder software from where I will re-direct to the Programming_For_Data_Analysis_Assignment directory I created locally:

<https://cmder.net/>

Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows.

2; Also make sure you have Python installed, or even better Anaconda:

[a] <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use.

[b] Anaconda:

<https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>

<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/>

Anaconda® is a package manager, an environment manager, a Python/R data science distribution, and a collection of over 1,500+ open source packages. Anaconda is free and easy to install, and it offers free community support.
Anaconda3 includes Python 3.7.

[c] Jupyter:

I strongly recommend installing Python and Jupyter using the Anaconda Distribution, which includes Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science (including NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib).

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

I'll be using Jupyter Notebook not Jupyter Lab in this assignment.

* Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating Jupyter notebooks documents. It supports several languages like Python (IPython), Julia, R etc. and is largely used for data analysis, data visualization and further interactive, exploratory computing.

* JupyterLab is a popular 'new' interface for working with Jupyter Notebooks. It is an interactive development environment for working with notebooks, code and data — and hence extremely extensible.

Once I'm in the Programming_For_Data_Analysis_Assignment directory, I will then launch "jupyter notebook" command and make the changes to the notebook.

To see the content of the jupyter file, i.e. Programming_Assignment.ipynb, just go to my my github account online and repository <https://github.com/HenkT28/Programming_For_Data_Analysis_Assignment)>.
