## Problem statement

This readme contains background info, instructions, and research concerning the numpy.random package in Python [2].
I was required to create a Jupyter [5] notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.

2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.

3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.

4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

### Prerequisites - how to run the code

1; Make sure you have Python installed, or even better Anaconda:

[a] <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

Python is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, making it freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use. 

[b] Anaconda:

<https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>

<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/>

Anaconda® is a package manager, an environment manager, a Python/R data science distribution, and a collection of over 1,500+ open source packages. Anaconda is free and easy to install, and it offers free community support.
Anaconda3 includes Python 3.7.

[c] Jupyter:

We strongly recommend installing Python and Jupyter using the Anaconda Distribution, which includes Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

<https://jupyter.org/install>

2; We'll be using Cmder software for launching "jupyter notebook" in the appropriate Programming_For_Data_Analysis_Assignment directory locally:

<https://cmder.net/>

### Reading script code

If you want to read the script code, and accompanying Problem Assessment README, most text editors would be sufficient, but I recommend notepad ++ or even better visual studio code. 

https://code.visualstudio.com/

<https://code.visualstudio.com/download>

It's a free and open source. It has Integrated Git, debugging and extensions. 

It can be accessed from Cmder prompt, by typing the following shortcut:

λ code .

<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows>

Tip:

Setup will add Visual Studio Code to your %PATH%, so from the console you can type 'code .' to open VS Code on that folder.

[a] Make sure you go to the directory first containing the python scripts.

[b] Once you're in the correct directory, enter the shortcut command, and keep in mind there is a space between word code and the dot.
