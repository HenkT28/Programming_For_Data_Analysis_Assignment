# Programming_For_Data_Analysis_Assignment repository

This repository contains all my work for Programming for Data Analysis Assignment 2019.

It contains background info, instructions, and research concerning the numpy.random package in Python [2].

To access the repository, please go through below instructions.

1). Go to Github web site - User Account: HenkT28

## Problem statement

I was required to create a Jupyter [5] notebook explaining the use of the numpy.random package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided in the package.

There are four distinct tasks to be carried out in this Jupyter notebook:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.

2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.

3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.

4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

## Installing Cmder and Ananconda (which includes NumPy, Jupyter), and HowTo run Jupyter

To answer the four distinct tasks, it was required of me to install some software packages:

* To install NumPy [2] on your local machine, I would advise you to download the anaconda package distribution [8], which installs python [9] and other important python libraries including NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib (useful for machine learning).

Anaconda supports Windows, Mac and Linux.

<https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>

<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/>

Anaconda® is a package manager, an environment manager, a Python/R data science distribution, and a collection of over 1,500+ open source packages. Anaconda is free and easy to install, and it offers free community support.
Anaconda3 includes Python 3.7.

* The Jupyter Notebook [5] is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

I'll be using Jupyter Notebook not Jupyter Lab in this assignment (see below the difference between the 2 interfaces):

-> Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating Jupyter notebooks documents. It supports several languages like Python (IPython), Julia, R etc, and is largely used for data analysis, data visualization and further interactive, exploratory computing.

-> JupyterLab is a popular 'new' interface for working with Jupyter Notebooks. It is an interactive development environment for working with notebooks, code and data — and hence extremely extensible.

<https://jupyter.org/install>

* Cmder is a software package which provides a nice command line interface on Windows [10].

<https://cmder.net/>

I use Cmder (command line interface) for changing the working directory on my local machine, i.e. Programming_For_Data_Analysis_Assignment, from there I launch "jupyter notebook" command, and make changes to it.
