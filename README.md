## Problem statement

I created this Jupyter [5] notebook explaining the use of the numpy.random package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided in the package.

There are four distinct tasks I carried out in this Jupyter notebook:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.

2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.

3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.

4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

## Installing Cmder, VS Code and Ananconda (which includes NumPy, Jupyter)

To answer these four tasks, I installed and used a number of different software packages:

* Anaconda Distribution

The open-source Anaconda Distribution is the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. [8]

It is the industry standard for developing, testing, and training on a single machine, enabling individual data scientists to:

    Quickly download 1,500+ Python/R data science packages.
    Manage libraries, dependencies, and environments with Conda.
    Develop and train machine learning and deep learning models with scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Theano.
    Analyze data with scalability and performance with Dask, NumPy, pandas, and Numba.
    Visualize results with Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, Datashader, and Holoviews.

Anaconda is free and easy to install, and it offers free community support.

Anaconda3 includes Python 3.7.

* Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook [5] is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

As the Anaconda Distribution includes the Jupyter Notebook as well, there was no need to download and install it separately.

<https://jupyter.org/install>

* NumPy

To use NumPy [2] on the local machine, I downloaded and installed anaconda package distribution, which installs Python [9] and other important Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and SciPy (useful for machine learning).

It contains among other things:

    A powerful N-dimensional array object.

    Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions.

    Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code.

    Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.

* Pandas

Pandas is a common Python tool for data manipulation and analysis, and is included with Anaconda. [55]

* Seaborn

Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. Again it comes installed with Anaconda. [57]

* Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell (ala MATLAB or Mathematica), web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits. It comes with anaconda package distribution. [56]

* SciPy

SciPy is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. [58]

* Cmder

Cmder is a software package which provides a nice command line interface on Windows [10].

I use Cmder (command line interface) for changing the working directory on my local machine, i.e. Programming_For_Data_Analysis_Assignment, from there I launch Jupyter notebook.

* Visual Studio Code

VS Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor.

It is a new type of tool that combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. Code provides comprehensive editing and debugging support, an extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools. [52]

I used it to make changes to the readme in my repository.

## HowTo run Jupyter notebook

I'll be using Jupyter Notebook not Jupyter Lab in this assignment (see below the difference between the 2 interfaces):

-> Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating Jupyter notebooks documents. It supports several languages like Python (IPython), Julia, R etc, and is largely used for data analysis, data visualization and further interactive, exploratory computing.

-> JupyterLab is a popular 'new' interface for working with Jupyter Notebooks. It is an interactive development environment for working with notebooks, code and data — and hence extremely extensible.

Once I'm in the correct working directory, i.e. Programming_For_Data_Analysis_Assignment, I start Jupyter by running "jupyter notebook" command through Cmder.

The jupyter notebook is called Programming_Assignment.ipynb, and contains the body of my work.
